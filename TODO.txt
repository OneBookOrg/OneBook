OneBook TODO List


- Create popover when a user attempts to login but provides incorrect credentials

- When a user signs up it should redirect them to a user profile page which allows them to update all their information. (Phone number -required, email-optional, class schedule-optional, If you think of anything else that would be beneficial to add go ahead)

- Add a search_page.html that users can go to in order to search for organizations they want to join.


- When a user clicks on the blue check box next to the organization on their blank.html page it should take them to a page populated with each user in that organization and their information (prob just gonna look like a spreadsheet for now)
	- If a user is clicked on their information is blown up large as a popover.
	- If a user clicks on their own information it gives them the option to edit 	  their info.
	- Phone number, email (class schedule but need to change user schema to fit)
